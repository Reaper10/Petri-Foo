Petri-Foo
---------

Petri-Foo is a fork of the Specimen Sampler project. Specimen was 
originally developed by Pete Bessman. See the AUTHORS file for
the list of other authors who've made contributions.

Petri-Foo is forked and developed by James Morris.


STAGE I GOALS
-------------

The primary goal of forking Specimen to create Petri-Foo was to allow 
frequency modulation of the LFOs, and to allow user selection of 
modulation sources throughout the program.

This has been accomplished.


STAGE II GOALS
--------------

Once stage 1 was complete, these were ideas I originally planned upon 
implementing:

  * Sample position retrigger by LFO.  TODO.
  * Sample start position modulation.  TODO.
  * Sample loop position modulation.   TODO.
  * X-fades for loops/retriggers.      Basic implementation..

  * Replace existing filter implementation. TODO.
  * Visual display of ADSRs and LFOs.       FORGOTTEN.
  * Noise modulation source.                TODO.
  * Sample and Hold.                        TODO.

  * Effects via LADSPA/LV2                  UNNECESSARY


WHAT HAPPENED INSTEAD
---------------------

  * Removal of deprecated GTK/GDK code
  * Default auto-generated patch/sample
  * Many code re-arrangements
  * Mark navigation in waveform display
  * Opening of raw audio formats
  * Complete rewrite of bank file I/O code and XML file layout.
  * MIDI Controllers subsumed as modulation sources.
  * Amplitude modulation added to LFOs.


STAGE III GOALS
---------------

  * Obtain a stable feature set
  * Sort out value mapping of MIDI controllers
  * Figure out how to best handle state/switchable items that are
    often controlled by MIDI controllers (ie portamento on/off)
  + Sample point modulation as listed in stage 2 goals
  + Figure out how to best handle things that are triggered
  - Random/noise source
  - Sample and hold

WHY HAVE I FORKED SPECIMEN?
---------------------------

1) I think my changes are too much of a departure.
2) Development of Specimen was dead.
3) I had ideas for which I wanted the freedom to follow.
