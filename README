Petri-Foo
---------

Petri-Foo is a fork of the Specimen Sampler project. Specimen was 
originally developed by Pete Bessman. See the AUTHORS file for
the list of other authors who've made contributions.

Petri-Foo is forked and developed by James Morris <james@jwm-art.net>


GOALS
-----

The primary goal of forking Specimen to create Petri-Foo is to allow 
frequency modulation of the LFOs.

The secondary goal is to make the LFOs and ADSRs independant from
their current functions instead of dedicated to a particular function.

The primary and secondary goals are really as one. Adapting the user 
interface alongside the development of these goals is a given (as is
broken patch save/load/duplicate).


STAGE II
--------

Once the primary and secondary goals are complete there is a whole 
raft of ideas of which it will be the choice of my whims as to which I 
tackle next:

  * Sample position retrigger by LFO.
  * Sample start position modulation.
  * Sample loop position modulation.
  * X-fades for loops/retriggers.

  * Replace existing filter implementation.
  * Visual display of ADSRs and LFOs.
  * Noise modulation source.
  * Sample and Hold -- if you're going to have a noise source... ?

  * Effects via LADSPA (and LV2 if I'm feeling *really* brave).

  * Fork the fork.

The sample retriggering and sample position modulation features are all 
features I implemented in my non-real-time modular synth "wcnt - Wav
Composer Not Toilet"* and are features which I happen to desire in a
sampler, which is justification enough for me to implement them.

* http://wcnt.sf.net

The existing filter in Specimen is poor. I propose replacing it with the 
LPF2 filter from ZynAddSubFX. In addition I also plan to add the HPF2 
filter.

Both of these features will depend heavily upon the ability of my coding 
skills as to whether they will come to fruition. Though I am forever 
doubting my coding skills, my track record in proving my doubts wrong is 
good. But in this case, my DSP skills are basic in the least.

Enough rambling...

DEVELOPMENT

WHY HAVE I FORKED SPECIMEN?
---------------------------

1) I think my changes are too much of a departure.
2) Development of Specimen is dead.
3) It is so.
