loose guidelines.


General Guidelines
------------------

* Do join the petri-foo-devel mailing list

* Use of the word awesome is banned (whether applicable or not)


Patches
-------

* You may email me patches as attachments
* Very simple patches may be emailed inline to me or the list
* Try to avoid making whitespace changes in patches


Code Contributions via Git
--------------------------

* Try not to group unrelated commits into a single pull request


Rough Coding Style
------------------

* Line width <= 76 characters
* Do not use tab characters
* Do not leave trailing spaces
* Indents four spaces
* Braces always go on newline
* Space after comma (unless the line becomes 77 characters)
* Keywords such as if, for, have space before open bracket
* Function calls do not have space before open bracket
* Function declarations in headers should be aligned and parameters should
  only be named when clarity demands
