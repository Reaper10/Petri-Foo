"I would like to see loopingfeatures like the Ensoniq samplers which should not
add many cpu load.  For instance midi controlled loop start and end, loop
offset and -let me call it so- PPG wavetablemode where the loop jumps always a
defined amount so it switches waveforms. Ensoniq called it transwave."
