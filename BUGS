KNOWN BUGS
==========

* mixer_mixdown is sometimes called before mixer_set_jack_client
resulting in a segfault. i've not yet determined if that statement
is true or not, but it seems likely.

Known Bugs
==========

* Create some patches, load some samples, connect to JACK, and start
running a MIDI pattern .  Then, flick back and forth between the
patches quickly (a mousewheel is handy for this).  JACK will fail with
something along the lines of "unable to execute processing graph
(invalid file descriptor)".  JACK will stop processing data until
Specimen is closed (it will exit with a segfault); JACK and all of
it's clients will then resume normal operation. [This seems to have
magically disappeared, which I find quite disturbing.  Can anybody
reproduce it? --pete]

* Sample start/stop and loop points don't behave properly when
switching audio sample rates.  It's probably time to store the audio
sample rate along with the session file, BTW.

* Midi syncing appears to be broken with Fedora Core 2's kernel.  If
you compile --enable-debug you'll see the gory details.

* Midi syncing drifts like a bitch anyway.

* Help -> About -> credits causes a segfault.

* audio settings dialog currently resets jack client name to default
"specimen" instead of using previously set name.
