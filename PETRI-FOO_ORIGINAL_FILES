PETRI-FOO ORIGINAL FILES

* src/dish_file.[ch]
	these replace beef.[ch] and are so substantially different
	i consider them to be my own original work.

* src/midi_control.h
	so very loosely based on control.h that again i consider it
	to be substantially different enough to be my own work.

* src/mod_src.[ch]
	routines for handling modulation sources. implemented
	specifically for petri-foo.

* src/names.[ch]
	routines for getting names of things. implemented
	specifically for petri-foo.

* src/gui/mod_src_gui.[ch]
	routines for generating GUI elements specifically with
	modulation routing in mind. implemented specifcally
	for petri-foo.

* src/gui/mod_section.[ch]
	routines for generating the modulation section widgets.
	implemented specifically for petri-foo.

* src/gui/basic_combos.[ch]
	routines for generating combo boxes. implemented for
	petri-foo.

* src/gui/param_tab.[ch]
	generic replacement for specimens filtertab also
	handling the amp and pitch tabs. the most tenuous
	of links with specimen make me consider it my
	origin work.
