note: these items are in addition to features mentioned
in the README as goals for Petri-Foo.


-Sampler - xfades/fadeins


-Fix and remove artefacts arising from use of LAT for log_amplitude
 function in maths.[ch] (research info online about alternatives
 such as curved ADSRs  for example).

-Add context menu to patch list (I did this in June 2008 but it was
 never adopted).

-Restore refresh functions in most GTK GUI classes
-Clean/tidy gobject/custom widget code/creation/whatever
 ie try to ascertain if it's done properly or not yet!


-Replace PHAT with custom cairo-based widgets


-Get data members residing in GUI GtkObjectClass into private data structs.
 maybe.. it might be more important for some than others.


-Sample Editor
    + two tool modes: pointer, and zoom
    + zoom tool: select area and zoom
    + pointer tool: *drag* play/loop point markers
    + zoom in/out/all buttons


-Surely keyboard tracking is missing? Surely? C'mon?
