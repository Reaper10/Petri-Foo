note: these items are in addition to features mentioned
in the README as goals for Petri-Foo.


-Fix and remove artefacts arising from use of LAT for log_amplitude
 function in maths.[ch] (research info online about alternatives
 such as curved ADSRs  for example).

-Add context menu to patch list (I did this in June 2008 but it was
 never taken).

-Restore refresh functions in most GTK GUI classes


-Port deprecated GDK line drawing code to Cairo (ie sample editor)
  - quite important if we want Petri-Foo to live a long life.
