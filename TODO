-------------
note: these items are in addition to features mentioned
in the README as goals for Petri-Foo.

-Show bank name in window title rather than petri-foo - petri-foo.

-Some kind of file container where samples can be saved along
 with bank file. Ie, for distribution of banks and/or
 resampled samples (possibly).


-Fix and remove artefacts arising from use of LAT for log_amplitude
 function in maths.[ch] (research info online about alternatives
 such as curved ADSRs  for example).

-Add context menu to patch list (I did this in June 2008 but it was
 never adopted).

-Replace PHAT with invented-here custom cairo-based widgets


-Sample Editor
    + two tool modes: pointer, and zoom
    + zoom tool: select area and zoom
    + pointer tool: *drag* play/loop point markers
    + zoom in/out/all buttons
