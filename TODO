note: these items are in addition to features mentioned
in the README as goals for Petri-Foo.


-Fix and remove artefacts arising from use of LAT for log_amplitude
 function in maths.[ch] (research info online about alternatives
 such as curved ADSRs  for example).

-Add context menu to patch list (I did this in June 2008 but it was
 never taken).

-Restore refresh functions in most GTK GUI classes


-Port deprecated GDK line drawing code to Cairo (sample editor done)
  - quite important if we want Petri-Foo to live a long life.


-Get data members residing in GUI GtkObjectClass into private data structs.


-Sample Editor
    + two tool modes: pointer, and zoom
    + zoom tool: select area and zoom
    + pointer tool: *drag* play/loop point markers
    + zoom in/out/all buttons
